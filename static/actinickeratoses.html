	    		What is this lesion?
	    		</b><br>
				Actinic Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma are common noninvasive, variants of squamous cell carcinoma that can be treated locally without surgery. These lesions may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma – which is usually not pigmented. 

	    	</li>
	    	<br>
			<li><b>
				What does it look like? 
				</b><br>
				Both types commonly show surface scaling and commonly are devoid of pigment. Actinic keratoses are more common on the face and Bowen’s disease is more common on other body sites.
			</li>			
			<br>
			<li><b>
				Causes
				</b><br>
				Both types are induced by UV-light. The surrounding skin is usually typified by severe sun damaged (except in cases of Bowen’s disease that are caused by HPV infection). 
				<br>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>
				Known risk factors
				<blockquote>
				<li> Have a history of a lot of sun exposure/sunburn </li>
				<li> Older than 40 </li>
				<li> Live in a sunny place </li>
				<li> Work outdoors </li>
				<li> Chronic systemic immunosuppression </li>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
			</li>	
			<br>
			<li><b>
				Should I see a doctor?
				</b><br>
				YES. If left untreated, 5-10% of these lesions will turn into a type of skin cancer squamous cell carcinoma. It is best to have the lesion treated by a doctor. 
			</li>	
			<br>
			<li><b>
				What the doctor would do about it?
				</b><br>
				Treatment options include lesion directed (liquid nitrogen cryotherapy) and field directed therapies (topical creams and photodynamic therapy).
