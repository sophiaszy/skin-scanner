	    		What is this lesion?
	    		</b><br>
				Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a common variant of epithelial skin cancer that rarely metastasizes but grows destructively if untreated. 

	    	</li>
	    	<br>
			<li><b>
				What does it look like? 
				</b><br>
				BCCs appear in different morphologic variants (flat, nodular, pigmented, cystic). 

				<br>
				Nodular BCC is the most common type typically found in sun exposed sites. They are translucent nodules or plaques on the skin with raised rolled edge and ulceration.
				<br>

 				Superficial BCCs are commonly found on the trunk or extremities. They are well circumscribed scaly red plaques with fine border along periphery.
 				<br>

				Pigmented BCCs has prominent pigment present within the lesion and tend to occur in darker skin types. They may be mistaken for melanoma based on their clinical appearances.

			</li>	
			<br>
			<li><b>
				Known risk factors
				</b><br>
				Risk factors for skin cancers include:
				<blockquote>
				<li> excessive prior sun exposure </li>
				<li> presence of multiple skin moles </li>
				<li> presence of abnormal-looking moles </li>
				<li> family history of skin cancer </li>
				<li> chronic systemic immunosuppression </li>
				</blockquote>
				Ultraviolet induced types of melanoma include superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma. 
				<br>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>
				Should I see a doctor?
				</b><br>
				YES. BCC is highly treatable. It is best to have the lesion treated by a doctor. The earlier BCC is diagnosed, the better the patientâ€™s chance of survival. 
			</li>	
			<br>
			<li><b>
				What the doctor would do about it?
				</b><br>
				Treatment options include simple surgical excision, electrodessication and curettage, micrographic surgery and radiation therapies.
